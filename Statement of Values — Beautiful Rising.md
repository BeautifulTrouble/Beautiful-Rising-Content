# Statement of values

*This document is a work in progress. We welcome input on these values and expect that they will evolve throughout the production of the toolkit. Add feedback here or email dave@beautifultrouble.org*

**The Beautiful Rising team is committed to embodying the following values in every aspect of our work:**

#### People power and international solidarity 
In our work of articulating and sharing the strategies that make social movements more creative and more effective, we prioritize the participation, wisdom, and active leadership of those on the front lines of these struggles, particularly women, youth, indigenous peoples, people living in poverty, and those who face discrimination or marginalization on the basis of their political views, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, class, race, or religion. We support and stand in solidarity with popular movements in their efforts to exercise grassroots democratic power in opposition to local elites and geopolitical interests. Guided by this core understanding, we seek to model true international solidarity in every aspect of our work.

#### Anti-imperialism
We reject efforts by imperial powers, transnational corporations, financial institutions, international NGOs, and other global and regional actors to suppress local and national autonomy in the global south through economic exploitation, tied aid, odious debt, or clandestine support for elite dissident groups. We recognize unequal power relations generated by historical and structural violence. We not only commit to complete transparency in our funding sources and our aims, we also commit to fighting these imperialist structures and policies. 

#### On-the-ground ethics
We seek to share tools that will amplify the creativity and effectiveness of the struggles of popular movements. Though our focus is on building mass movements and achieving social change through nonviolent direct action, we do not presume to dictate the range of acceptable responses to each situation. In all cases, we encourage a realistic assessment of the risks involved and rigorous planning to address those risks. 

#### Privacy-enhancing technologies
The tools that we use in our communication and collaboration with contributors will respect and enhance privacy to the greatest extent possible. If we are required to use systems or networks that we believe to be inherently insecure, we commit to providing clear guidance to our collaborators on how to protect themselves, their identity, and their location while working with us.

#### Build with, not for
Recognizing that we are working within a limited understanding of the technical realities facing activists in the global south, we are committed to only exploring solutions that are actively developed through direct collaboration with our southern partners. When and where possible, we will strive to invest in existing open-source software initiativesâ€”to both build with, and give back to those projects.

#### Agile & responsive engagement
We are committed to providing open and safe mechanisms for project partners and Beautiful Rising audiences to offer criticism and feedback as the project unfolds, and to adjusting and adapting both our process and the resulting toolkit in response to criticisms raised and lessons learned. 

#### Disclaimer
The Beautiful Rising team can assume no responsibility for the risks incurred, the victories achieved, the defeats suffered, nor any unintended consequences that may arise from use of the toolkit.
