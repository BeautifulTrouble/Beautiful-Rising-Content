### Principles
**Anger works best when you have the moral high ground**
Anyone can act
Balance art and message
					Beware the tyranny of structurelessness
					Brand or be branded
					Bring the issue home
**Challenge patriarchy as you organize
Choose tactics that support your strategy
Choose your target wisely**
					Consensus is a means, not an end
Consider your audience
Debtors of the world, unite!
Delegate
Do the media’s work for them
					Don’t dress like a protester
Don’t just brainstorm, artstorm!
Don’t mistake your group for society
Enable, don’t command
**Escalate strategically**
Everyone has balls/ovaries of steel
**If protest is made illegal, make daily life a protest
Jury-rig solutions (or, How would MacGyver protest?)**
Kill them with kindness
Know your cultural terrain
Lead with sympathetic characters
**Maintain nonviolent discipline**
Make new folks welcome
**Make the invisible visible**
Make your actions both concrete and communicative
					No one wants to watch a drum circle
Pace yourself
Play to the audience that isn’t there
Praxis makes perfect

**Put your target in a decision dilemma**
					Recapture the flag

**Simple rules can have grand results**
**Stay on message**
Take leadership from the most impacted
**Take risks, but take care(R)**

**The real action is your target’s reaction**

This ain’t the Sistine Chapel (or Taj Mahal)
**Turn the tables**
