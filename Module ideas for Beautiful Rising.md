# New module ideas for Beautiful Rising

### Tactics
* Blockade (Gabi Juns?)
* Community complaint boxes ([ActionAid Mozambique](http://vimeo.com/102927619))
* Community theatre
* Hunger strike (Waging Nonviolence folks?)
* Participatory budgeting (draw from/collaborate with Beautiful Solutions?)

### Principles
* Shine a light on abuses of power

###Theories
* Story of self / us / now (Nisreen Haj Ahmad?)
* International solidarity (Leah Hunt-Hendrix?)

...some useful, practically grounded mix of concepts related to anti-imperialism, post-colonialism, the concept of the “third world”, etc., drawing on Eqbal Ahmad, Vijay Prashad and others?

### Case Studies
* Colombia: Mimes Not Cops: Changing traffic culture in Bogotá
* Burma: SHAN activist campaign of mailing underwear to generals

### Practitioners

* Friends of the Congo (Maurice Carney, ED, The highlighting of cultural assets in resistance ought to be particularly interesting - see a sample of Art on the Frontline coming out of DRC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ6eRV4eBnI - from Rae) 
* Bil'in Popular Committee - Iyad Burnat - Palestine - friday demonstrations (Rae)
