To resolve:
The links to related modules, the style guide, and the complete list of modules need to be updated once these exist for this project.

Preliminary notes:
Some example case studies from Beautiful Trouble: Whose Tea Party?, Trail of Dreams, Barbie Liberation Organization, & Taco Bell Boycott

Note: We want to ensure that the case studies we publish are not just accounts of cool or fun actions, but ideally, that they're accounts of actions that changed the situation, that changed what was considered possible, and/or that showcase new and exciting principles or tactics that activists in other places could learn from and adapt.

Many questions may be answered in the style guide.
