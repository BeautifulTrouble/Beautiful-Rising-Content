# Tactic questionnaire

*A **tactic **is a specific action that an organization might take in order to achieve its strategic goals – for example, a march, a blockade, or a creative disruption (disrupting a target's media event to communicate an opposing message).*

*To help us compile the best and most useful tactics, please choose one tactic that you find useful in achieving your goals, and answer these questions as fully as you're able — your answers will help ensure that the write-up of this tactic is as accurate, complete, and interesting as possible! *

*If a question is not relevant to your particular tactic, simply skip it and move on.*




## What are you calling this tactic, and what action or series of actions does it involve?

*Hint: Is the name of the tactic phrased in a way that it can be applied in different ways and different situations? E.g. 'Creative leafletting' rather than 'Filling paper lanterns with leaflets and then releasing them.'  Many of the best tactics are immediately recognizable as a distinct form of action (e.g. hunger strike, flash mob, encampment), yet are broad enough that people in very different contexts can adapt the tactic to their context.*
