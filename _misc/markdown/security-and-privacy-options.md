Beautiful Rising: Security & Privacy Options
============================================

Our commitment to security and privacy is outlined in our [<span class="Definition"> statement of values
</span>](statement-of-values-for-beautiful-rising.md):

*The tools that we use to communicate and collaborate will respect and enhance participants' privacy to the greatest extent possible. If we are required to use systems or networks that we believe to be inherently insecure, we commit to providing clear guidance to our collaborators on how to protect themselves, their identity, and their location while working with us.*

If you are collaborating with us -- as a workshop participant, as a
contributor, as an advisor, as an ally -- we encourage you to read the
following security considerations:

Web sites & services
--------------------

We may occasionally share documents with you via established web sites that routinely collect personal information. For example, we might invite you to view and complete an online survey. In this situation, we encourage you to protect your privacy by taking the following steps <span class="T1"> before </span> visiting the survey link:

-   Logging out of any web sites or services that you may be currently
    signed-in to, e.g., Facebook, Google, etc.

-   Using the private browser feature of your web browser. Each web
    browser is different, but this feature is typically called
    "Incognito" or "Private browsing." You can learn more about this
    feature by using the "Help" menu in your browser and searching for
    "privacy."

Where possible, we will refrain from circulating links that may inadvertently compromise your personal information. We will typically do this by directing you to web sites that do not require you to sign-in, and by relying on sites where we have a reasonable belief that information collection is limited.

Mobile applications & services
------------------------------

Similarly, during your involvement with the project, you may hear about new and interesting mobile applications. We encourage you to approach these mobile applications with common sense and some basic vigilance. Here are some common scenarios to be aware of:

-   Some mobile applications (a good example is the popular messaging
    application Viber) will request access to the contacts on your
    phone. You should be aware that many of these applications will send
    your contacts (sometimes insecurely) from your phone to another
    location. This could result in inadvertently providing your entire
    address book of contacts to another party.

-   Many popular mobile applications claim to be "secure," when in fact
    they offer very little in the way of protection at all. This can be
    difficult to assess, so we recommend that you attempt to undertake
    some basic research ***[can we suggest trustworthy sites that publish good research?]*** before installing and trusting new mobile
    applications (we provide some specific recommendations of tools that
    we believe to be more secure below).

Communicating with us
---------------------

While collaborating with us, we may ask you to submit
written material. If you would like to take steps to help ensure that
this material is not easily read by others, we encourage you [<span
class="Definition"> research your options
</span>](https://ssd.eff.org/en/index) or ask us for assistance.
Beautiful Rising is not able to provide digital security training
at this time, but each team member has been briefed to be able to
provide you with straightforward options for communicating with them
security.

If communicating with the Beautiful Rising project would put you at risk
in any way, please refrain from doing so directly, and explore
alternative, possibly indirect ways to contact us, such as the following:

### Email

Each member of the [<span class="Definition"> Beautiful Rising team
</span>](https://github.com/BeautifulTrouble/Beautiful-Rising-Research/blob/master/the-team-and-contributors.md)
has a published public PGP key. That key can be used to secure your
communication with that person, reducing the risk of the message being
read by another party. Securing your communication in this way does not
remove the evidence that you've communicated with us.

If you are not familiar with PGP, please contact the team member you want to communicate with and ask for alternative ways to transmit information to them.

### Chat

Most members of the [<span class="Definition"> Beautiful Rising team
</span>](https://github.com/BeautifulTrouble/Beautiful-Rising-Research/blob/master/the-team-and-contributors.md)
have published their identity on the service [<span class="Definition">
Chat Secure </span>](https://chatsecure.org/) . Chat Secure is an
"Encrypted Messenger for iOS and Android" that enables you to send short
messages securely to members of our team.

We are also investigating the [<span class="Definition"> Telegram
</span>](https://telegram.org/) messenger at this time. If you are using
Telegram already, please let us know. ***[Telegram seems the less buggy and more user-friendly of the two -- perhaps we should promote it first?]***

### Phone calls

We may also ask to speak with you on the phone, or you may find that a
voice call is the easiest way to convey some information. Most members
of the team are set-up to initiate and receive calls using the encrypted
voice application called [<span class="Definition"> Redphone
</span>](https://whispersystems.org/) on Android or [<span
class="Definition"> Signal
</span>](https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/) on iOS. If you have
the option of communicating with one of these mobile applications, we
recommend it -- keep in mind, however, that these applications require a
wifi or data connection.

### Video meetings

To facilitate one-on-one or multi-party video conferences, we have
set up Jitsi Meet. It is an equivalent to Google Hangouts
and similar systems. In the course of collaborating with us, we will
provide you with access to this tool and will encourage you to use it
instead of other, potentially less-secure alternatives.

If you have questions about this document, please contact us (securely
if possible) using one of the methods above. Failing that, you can send
an e-mail to phillip AT beautifultrouble DOT org.

Next actions for this document
------------------------------

* [âˆš] Simplify the language
* [x] Review Dave's edits and comments in ***[awkward bold brackets]***
* [ ] This still kind of reads like a Terms & Conditions statement... I wonder if we could/should distill it into a "3 ways to communicate with us securely" document, followed by a "learn more" directory of links to resources, services, tutorials, etc?
