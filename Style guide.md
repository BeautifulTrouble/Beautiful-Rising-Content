# Beautiful Rising Style Guide

*Rules are made to be broken... which is more easily done when you know the rules! Here are the rules.*

*If you have specific style questions, add them at the bottom and we’ll integrate the answers into the style guide.*

### Tone 
Engaging, upbeat, witty and conversational, but not overly informal. You may use first person “I” & “we” and speak forcefully and or quirkily as yourself, within reason. Where possible, avoid second-person prescriptive statements, especially "don't" statements. Rather than lecturing readers on what NOT to do (e.g. "don’t use ‘don’t’ statements!"), focus on describing the principles and tactics that make activism more effective generally.

### Audience
Assume a broad, global audience who are comfortable reading English, but for whom it isn't necessarily their first language. They’re smart and are politically on-side, but haven’t necessarily read all the theorists the same theorists as you, organized a demo or been arrested. They may be relatively new to activism. They may not be familiar with the political context you're writing about. They may be reading this in 2018 or 2020, when today’s headlines and buzzwords will have faded from memory but the principles and theories will still be relevant. They have likely come to this toolkit looking for inspiration, edification, and new ways of thinking about creative activism.

### Spelling
* United States spelling.
* Spell out numbers below 11 in text (ten, nine, etc.)
* email (no hyphen)
* Spell out percent (not per cent, not %)
* Spell out names of U.S. states
* “Nonviolent” as one word.
* Cooperative (no hyphen), but co-op (hypen).

### Punctuation
* Dashes should appear as an m-dash with a space on each side — thus.
* Avoid the serial comma unless it’s necessary for clarity in longer lists: “...ethical, impish and frothy...”
* Single quotes for text within quotes. Double quotes everywhere else.
* Ellipses are three periods separated by spaces, and with a space on either side. For example, “Texty text text . . . text text texty text.”

### Capitalization
* Capitalize principle titles and document elements sentence style (“Use the power of ritual”, “In sum,” “Why it worked,” “Contributed by”).
* Lowercase items in a list that aren’t proper nouns (principles, tactics, theories).
* Capitalize a sentence following a colon.
* Capitalize Internet and the Web, but lowercase website. 

### Word counts
All suggested word counts in templates are merely ballpark suggestions — shorter is almost always sweeter, if it's possible, and sometimes longer is necessary.

### Document formatting
TBD

### Text formatting
* Single space between sentences. Like that, there.
* When first referring to a concept, such as *ethical spectacle,* put it in italics.
* When referring to a word, like “bigalicious,” put it in quotes.
* Format a numbered list in the text as Chicago style commands: “ . . . the theory’s premises are: (1) that delicious food is good for you, (2) that vegan food can be good in moderation, and (3) that chai is the spice of life.”

### Citations
Cite sources in parentheses, author and year, with details at the bottom of the document (Boyd 2012).

### Links
Please add relevant links & further readings & additional how-to info in the “Learn more” section at the bottom of your write-up as they occur to you. This will help ensure a richer reading experience for visitors to the online version of the book.
Reference other Beautiful Rising or Beautiful Trouble modules by name, like this *(see PRINCIPLE: Reference other Beautiful Trouble modules by name)*. 

### Related modules
List related modules one per line, as a bullet list. E.g.

**Related principles:**
* Fake it till you make it
* Undercover cops make good note takers, but bad lovers
* Have a little fun, for fuck sake

When there are no items in a given “related” category, mark it N/A. E.g.
	
	**Related tactics**
	N/A

#### Learn more 
The goal of the “learn more” section is to provide more information “at-a-glance” for the reader, and should be formatted to be as simple and clear as possible. A simple description of the page and the link is all that is necessary. There is no period after any further insights entry.
